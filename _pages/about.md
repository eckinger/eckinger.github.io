Hi there- my name is Alexander. I enjoy throwing balls in the air, balancing on wiggly bridges in the sky, noodling around on my computer, and Anki. Check out my blog posts for more.

At the moment I am interested in pursuing a degree in Computational and Applied Mathematics. I am currently teaching myself python, in an effort to acquire a research position. Check out my github to see what I'm reading and working through. :) Thank you for reading.
