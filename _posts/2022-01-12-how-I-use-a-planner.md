Introduction
======
To preface, my planner strategy is based largely on Cal Newport's strategy from *How to Become a Straight-A Student*. However, it came to fruition principally from my friend Franklin's setup. It involves four main tools:
1. A pocket-sized notebook
2. A pencil
3. A pocket (I use my left pocket)
4. Google Calendar

I think my arrangement is best described through example.

A typical Tuesday
======
This is one of the simpler days in my week, so it'll be easier to explain.

The day begins by looking at Google Calendar. Note that today is Wednesday. Make sure to look at Tuesday!

Monday night I amassed a list of tasks to do, which are the orange tasks listed at the top of the Tuesday column. I also add these throughout the day Monday, when I get a chance on my computer or phone.

On Tuesday morning I get up, and because I get up with ample time before my first class I grab my notebook and time block the day based on events and tasks in google calendar.

Footloose
======
Throughout the day I can add new tasks to my calendar for the next day (or the same day). For example, if my workout runs 30 minutes late it only takes a minute or two to recalibrate the rest of my times. I didn't work out on Tuesday but you get the idea. This is really powerful- days rarely go according to plan, but the ease of editing this planner means I don't lose out on much.

If I need to quickly write down a new task on my plate, I can use the space on the left hand side of the page. I can then add it to google calendar whenever convenient. This rarely takes place, as my phone is almost always within reach or my computer is out (since classes are virtual at the moment).

On days where I can't write my schedule down so soon after waking, I do it during a lull in some other activity. For example, when I climb in the mornings I write down my schedule during the bus ride on the number 6. Obviously I don't need my planner to know that I have to catch it right after wake up, so I can afford to "start" my schedule after the first event of the day. I use this strategy often.

I'm not 100%. In fact, you can see on Tuesday that although I finished turning in an application for a summer program (that's task "turn in SFI app" and "thank Isabella") I didn't have it written down in the schedule. I finished those tasks after dinner- a time that I often play by ear. I do this on a case-by-case basis. The beginning of the quarter has a smaller workload, but in the future I would like to be more strict.

Shorthand
======
I've also made it a practice to write in shorthand- the notebook only needs to be readable to me. For example, I use clock hands to indicate 15 minutes after the hour, 30 minutes after the hour, and 45 minutes after the hour. I also write in a little 50-10 label for hour long blocks of work time. This indicates a pomodoro work session, with 50 minutes of work combined with 10 minutes of break.
