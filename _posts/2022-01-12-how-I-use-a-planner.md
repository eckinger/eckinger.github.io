Introduction
======
To preface, my planner strategy is based largely on Cal Newport's strategy from *How to Become a Straight-A Student*. However, it came to fruition principally from my friend Franklin's setup. It involves four main tools:
1. A pocket-sized notebook
2. A pencil
3. A pocket (I use my left pocket)
4. Google Calendar

I think my arrangement is best described through example.

A typical Tuesday
======
This is one of the simpler days in my week, so it'll be easier to explain.

The day begins by looking at Google Calendar.

Monday night I amassed a list of tasks to do, which are the orange tasks listed at the top of the Tuesday column. I also add these throughout the day Monday, when I get a chance on my computer or phone.

On Tuesday morning I get up, and because I get up with ample time before my first class I grab my notebook and time block the day based on events and tasks in google calendar.

Footloose
======
Throughout the day I can add new tasks to my calendar for the next day (or the same day)
