Here are some goals I have laid out for winter quarter 2022.

Goals
======
I want to:
1. climb three days a week, MWF. If I find this is unsustainable then two days a week, MW, would still make me happy.
2. continue working my way through the CS book I am reading.
3. implement LaTeX notetaking in class.
4. eat healthier.
5. go harder working out. I want to finish one cycle of 5/3/1 (taking 6 weeks) and start the next cycle. I also want to add some sort of high intensity interval training to my training regimen.
6. get an A in CS 151 and MATH 153. 
7. sleep on my back. I't's become comfortable for me, but I still need to make it the complete default without thought.
8. write one blog post per week.
9. make my sister a really awesome birthday gift.
10. not be in the lounge after 9:45 o'clock MTWTh.
