Here are some goals I have laid out for winter quarter 2022.

Goals
======
I want to:
1. climb three days a week, MWF. If I find this is unsustainable then two days a week, MW, would still make me happy.
2. continue working my way through the CS book I am reading.
3. implement LaTeX notetaking in class.
4. eat healthier.
5. go harder working out. I want to finish one cycle of 5/3/1 (taking 6 weeks) and start the next cycle.
6. get an A in both CS 151 and MATH 153. 
7. sleep on my back. It's become comfortable for me, but I still need to make it the complete default without thought.
8. write one blog post per week.
9. run 3x a week.
10. not be in the lounge after 9:45 o'clock MTWTh.

Evaluating Holiday Break Goals
======
In my first post, I listed a number of goals I wanted to achieve for holiday break.

1. I ended up cutting short my reading for this book; I found it to be extremely boring and slogging through it was violating my own values when it comes to reading. I believe that reading for pleasure should be just that; reading for pleasure. Instead I have begun reading Naomi Klein's *The Shock Doctrine*.
2. I did not finish this book. I finished the parts that I wanted to; the parts about python syntax. I felt no need to finish the book, for my longer-term goals.
3. I spent a while fiddling with and figuring out how to actually implement LaTeX snippets for notetaking. I believe I am at the point now where I can take notes during class, although it will likely take more time before I am able to be as fast as the lecturer. I consider this goal achieved!
4. I did not end up climbing at least three times a week, because the effects of my booster shot remained for an entire week. The one week I did spend at home I climbed plenty, however. The last week was spent in Arizona, so I had no access to a climbing gym.
5. See above, I was taken out by the booster shot and had no access to a gym in Arizona.
6. I don't remember exactly what I did, if anything, to this website. But there's nothing I would change about it right now so I say goal achieved!
7. I did this! Except for when I was in Arizona and recovering from the booster shot, so I count this as goal achieved!
8. See post #4. Goal achieved!
9. I was not able to train anything specifically, although I retained strength through climbing. Again, my booster shot and not having access to a pull-up bar with sufficient height and room hampered my efforts.
10. I didn't do any trad leading :(. I am bummed about this.

In the future I need to qualify my goals when it comes to reading. I don't think I will post goals about completing specific books, since literary interests change on a whim frequently. And I believe that flexibility should be practiced when it comes to reading- if a book brings no pleasure, stop wasting time on it.
