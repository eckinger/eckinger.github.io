On Saturday I went highlining with two friends of mine. I want to share some photos, in part because I want to learn how to insert images via markdown. Mostly because I want to share them, though.

I woke up at 5:15 AM and drove up to San Francisco, where I met my friends. We then drove around 2.5 hours to Cosumnes River Gorge, where we rigged a 60 meter line. An adjacent, 70 meters long, was up as well.

Here are a couple photos of the anchors.

A few weeks ago in physics class we were given the following problem in our pset.

I decided to reenact it for fun, and sent the photo to my study group.
