I have set for myself a number of goals to accomplish over holiday break.

Goals
======
I want to:
1. finally read superintelligence by Nick Bostrom.
2. finish AtBSwP by Al Sweigart.
3. fine-tune and optimize LaTeX notetaking.
4. climb at least three times a week, with an emphasis on bouldering.
5. continue 5/3/1 programming.
6. customize this website further.
7. sleep on a yoga mat in order to train back sleeping.
8. set goals for this coming winter quarter.
9. train for some calisthenics move.
10. do my first trad lead.

Some notes
------
If goal 3 goes well, I would also like to do a writeup of what my setup looks like. It is unclear to me how to define "going well," but I would like to get to a point where I can take lecture notes for MATH 153 in LaTeX. If I think I have gotten to that point I will attempt a writeup.

These goals were listed in no particular order, although some are significantly easier than others.
