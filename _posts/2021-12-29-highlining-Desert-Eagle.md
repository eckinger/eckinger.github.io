Yesterday I highlined in Tucson, AZ. I first highlined in Tucson with my friend David, a firefighter and paramedic. I took my first steps with him! I returned Monday planning to meet him and highline again, but he was unable to make it.

No worries though- I met a host of other slackers and reunited with my friend James, who I met in Wyoming where we did a 500m project together.

I spent Sunday in Tucson and then on Monday morning headed to Molino Canyon, where the line (dubbed Desert Eagle) was. I got on soon after arriving, and had a decent session. I then hung out with everyone there, enjoying the views and company.

Right before we derigged I got another session in, performing much more poorly. I still got some steps in and had fun, which is why I go! Now for some photos.
